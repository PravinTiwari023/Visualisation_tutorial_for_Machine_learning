# Visualisation_tutorial_for_Machine_learning
Matplotlib is one of the most popular and oldest plotting libraries in Python which is used in Machine Learning. In Machine learning, it helps to understand the huge amount of data through different visualisations.

Python features a large number of visualization libraries.

The most recent ones, like bokeh and holoviews, are very powerful. They allow us to easily create interactive plots that can be displayed in the browser. And the datashader extension makes it possible to show big data without killing the client browser.

Matplotlib, on the other hand, has been around for quite a while and might seem a bit limited with respect to more recent libraries. But most people are still using it (if only at times) and it excels at producing plots of publication quality for articles.

Clearly, you need to know matplotlib if you are to use scientific python at all, in particular for machine learning. So this tutorial will focus on this tool.

To illustrate the basic functionalities of matplotlib, we will work on a toy machine learning problem, and make plots that are actually useful in real life.

The toy problem will be the classification of examples with a single input variable x in two categories, 0 and 1, depending on the value of x.

For each category, the samples will follow the normal distribution. This means that they will be distributed according to a Gaussian probability density function (pdf).

This tutorial is interactive.

To run on Google Colab.
